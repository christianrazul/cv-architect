# CV Architect

Welcome to the repository of CV Architect, a dynamic resume builder application designed to help users create professional-looking CVs with ease. This project is not only a tool for job seekers but also serves as my personal learning project, where I delve into the depths of React's state management, explore the intricacies of the `useEffect` hook, and embrace the synergy of Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Project Overview

CV Architect aims to provide a seamless experience for users to craft their resumes by inputting their personal, professional, and educational information into a sleek user interface. This project has been an avenue for me to solidify my understanding of modern front-end development techniques and libraries.

## Core Learnings

- **Managing State**: Learning to efficiently manage the state in a complex application has been a cornerstone of this project. The state management patterns adopted are reflected in the robust and responsive user interface of CV Architect.
- **Using `useEffect`**: Harnessing the power of React's `useEffect` hook has been critical in handling side effects, fetching data, and responding to state and prop changes.
- **Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS**: I've embraced the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS and integrated it with Shadcn UI components to design a visually appealing and responsive UI.

## Features

- Intuitive step-by-step resume builder process.
- Real-time preview of the CV being created.
- Customizable sections for header, summary, skills showcase, work history, education, and even custom information.
- Export options to download the resume in different formats.
